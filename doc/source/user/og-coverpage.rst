Open-source simulation package for cw-EPR spectra. EPRsim has been
developed in the group of Prof. Dr. Stefan Weber at the University of
Freiburg, Freiburg im Breisgau, Germany, during the last couple of
years. EPRsim was developed by Stephan Rein. The program uses several
concepts described in  [#f1]_. EPRsim is open-source and available free of
charge.

Using EPRsim
============

Getting started
---------------

Import it as package when running Python.

.. code:: python

   import EPRsim.EPRsim as sim

Define parameters and run the simulation by invoking the simulate()
function of EPRsim.

.. code:: python

   Param = sim.Parameters()
   B, spc, flag = sim.simulate(Param)

The Parameters object
---------------------

A Parameters object can be instantiated with
``Param = sim.Parameters(parameter1 = value1, ... , parameterN = valueN)``

to make it Optional Parameters (with their defaults):

    Magnetic field vector
spcnumpy *(ndarray)*
    Intesity vector of the cw-EPR signal

flaglist *(int)*
    Flags with warning codes (below)
    0. Everything is alright
    1. Solid-state is not possible due to too large matrix dimension.
    2. Fast-motion/iso is not possible due to S > 1/2.

Technical details
-----------------

**Main function:** for the simulation of cw-EPR in different motional
regimes (isotropic, fast-motion and solid state) All spectra are
simulated as field sweep spectra.

**Isotropic/fast-motion:** For the fast-motion regime/isotropic limit,
the program solves the implicit Breit-Rabi formula  [#f2]_ in a
fixed-point iteration. Anisotropic line-broadening effects in the
fast-motion regime are calculated via the Kivelson formula  [#f3]_.
Currently, Euler angles between tensors are ignored by the algorithm!
All tensors (only relevant for fast-motion) need to be in their
principal axis system and colinear to each other.

**Solid-state:** In the solid-state regime, the program uses a full
matrix diagonalization algorithm. Therefore, only spin systems with a
Hilbert space dimension of dim(H) < 512 can be calculated. The powder
average is partially generated by interpolation of eigenvalues and
transition probabilitites (similar to  [#f4]_). The interpolation level is
automatically set by the program. The solid state algorithm treats
arbitrary spin systems as long as the Hilbert space dimension is within
the threshold. Spin-polarization can be defined (withing the electronic
sublevels) as zero-field populations. The program constructs (sparse)
density matrices out of the zero-field eigenvectors, to efficiently
calculate the population transformation from zero field to high field.
Per default, the program calculates with thermal equilibrium. Nuclear
quadrupolar couplings (for I > 0.5) are currently not implemented.
